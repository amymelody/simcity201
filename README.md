###Working components of v1
  + Josh's restaurant is working
  + Unit testing of ALL agents
  + A person can go into a house, sit in a chair, and leave the house
  + A person can go into the bank, and stay there
  + A person can switch roles, has a script to determine which roles to take on
  + The animation only works when you click inside a building
  
  



###Not working components of v1
  + Transportation: There are no cars or buses because Alfred left in the middle of the project. Wilcynski said that we do not need to worry about this aspect of the project because of that.
  + 


###How to run our simcity
  + Select a config file using the panel on the left, click the radio button, then cick the run scenario button. CLose the program after running each scenario. Run it again choosing a different scenario. 
  + Note that you will have to click inside some of the houses to make things progress in the animation. 

###Notes
  + For some reason, even though Anjali was unable to compile and run the program on her Mac, so she made changes on her teammates computers that were related to bank
