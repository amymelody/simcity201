SimCity201 Project Repository for CS 201 students

Please see the Wiki for instructions on running SimCity201.


###Working components of v1
  + Josh's restaurant is working
  + Unit testing of ALL agents
  + A person can go into a house, sit in a chair, and leave the house
  + A person can go into the bank, and stay there
  + A person can switch roles, has a script to determine which roles to take on
  + The animation only works when you click inside a building
  
  



###Not working components of v1
  + The bank is not functioning because git is not processing the changes that Anjali is pushing to the repository. We have fixed the issues but they are not upating. 
  + Transportation: There are no cars or buses because Alfred left in the middle of the project. Wilcynski said that we do not need to worry about this aspect of the project because of that.

###How to run our simcity


###Notes
  +For some reason, even though Anjali was updating her code and pushing to github, old versions of her code were still showing up online and other team members were pulling old versions of her code. There's an error that comes up when a manager tries to add a customer, but the issue was fixed but it still won't show up on github.
